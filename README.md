# Represent MIDI Object On Starknet ðŸ’«

An experimental project for representing and manipulating musical MIDI data as a [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/) smart contract.

## MIDI manipulation
This project allows you to do midi manipulation: 

- `Tempo flex`: change the tempos by a certain basis point.
- `Duration flex`: change the duration of all notes in a MIDI by a certain basis point.
- `Transposition`: shift the pitch of all notes in a MIDI by a certain number of semitones.
- `Velocity Scale`: adjust the velocity of all notes in a MIDI by a certain basis point.

## How to run the project? 

Install modules defined in package.json
```
npm install
```

Create a temporary environment
```
nix-shell
```

## Generate a contract
To represent a JSON object as a Starknet smart contract:
- Create a new folder and place the JSON file in it.
- Run the following task:
```
npx hardhat generateContract <path-to-json-file> <name-of-generated-file>
```
This will generate a new cairo file with the specified name in contracts folder.

### Example:
```
npx hardhat generateContract example/input/midi.json midi-generated
```
(I used the [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi) library to convert the object retrieved from the smart contract into a midi file.)

## Retrieve onchain object
Once your contract is deployed, you can call the smart contract's `retrieve_object` function to get a representation of your original JSON object. 

Run the following task:
```
npx hardhat retreiveMidi [--contract-name] [--contract-address] [--result-path] [--tempo-flex] [--duration-flex] [--transposition] [--velocity-scale]
```
This will retrieve the midi object from a deployed contract. 
- `contract-name`: name of the contract
- `contract-address`: address of the deployed contract
- `result-path`: path to the created midi file
- `tempo-flex`: change the tempos by a certain basis point
- `duration-flex`: change the duration of all notes in a MIDI file by a certain basis point
- `transposition`: shift the pitch of all notes in a MIDI file by a certain number of semitones
- `velocity-scale`: adjust the velocity of all notes in a MIDI file by a certain basis point

### Example:
```
npx hardhat retrieveMidi --contractName midi-generated --contractAddress 0x... --resultPath example/result/example.mid --tempoFlex 5000 --durationFlex -5000 --transposition 2 --velocityScale 3050
```
