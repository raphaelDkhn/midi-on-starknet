# Represent JSON Object On Starknet ðŸ’«

An experimental project for representing any JSON data structure as a [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/) smart contract. It demonstrates the feasibility of hosting complex objects, such as MIDI compositions, in smart contracts

## How to run the project? 

Install modules defined in package.json
```
npm install
```

Create a temporary environment
```
nix-shell
```

## Generate a contract
To represent a JSON object as a Starknet smart contract:
- Create a new folder and place the JSON file in it.
- Run the following command:
```
npx hardhat generateContract <path-to-json-file> <name-of-generated-file>
```
This will generate a new cairo file with the specified name in contracts folder.

### Example:
```
npx hardhat generateContract example/input/midi.json midi-generated
```
(I used the [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Midi) library to convert the object retrieved from the smart contract into a midi file.)

## Retrieve onchain object
Once your contract is deployed, you can call the smart contract's `retrieve_object` function to get a representation of your original JSON object. 
To convert this object back to a JSON style, you can use the [onchainObjectToJSON](https://github.com/raphaelDkhn/json2starknet/blob/main/utils/onchainObjectToJson.ts) function.
